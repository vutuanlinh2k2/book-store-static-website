        <p class="book-description">
          100,000 years ago, at least six human species inhabited the earth.
          Today there is just one. Us. Homo sapiens. How did our species succeed
          in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come
          together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in
          gods, nations and human rights; to trust money, books and laws; and to
          be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables and consumerism? And what will
          our world be like in the millennia to come? In Sapiens, Dr Yuval Noah
          Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to
          walk the earth to the radical – and sometimes devastating –
          breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific
          Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology,
          paleontology and economics, he explores how the currents of history
          have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and
          even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has
          unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our
          ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of
          the centuries to come? Bold, wide-ranging and provocative, Sapiens
          challenges everything we thought we knew about being human: our
          thoughts, our actions, our power ... and our future.
